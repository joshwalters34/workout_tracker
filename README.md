# Workout Tracker
This applicatiion allows a user to track their workouts.  Users can enter cardio or resistance exercises, tracking their reps, duration, etc.   

## Motivation
My motivation for this site is to make a site for users to easily track their workouts. In the past, I've found that creating a workout plan is the best way for me to continue working out.  This site allows me to create a cardio or resistance workout plan, which helps me to reach my goals.
